# Pipple

Pipple communicates with the Rippling API (currently only via API key).

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `pipple` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:pipple, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Why the name?

Pipple means the murmuring of rippling water, and it also sounds somewhat like "people". Since Rippling is HR software, it just seems apt.
